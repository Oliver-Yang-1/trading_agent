## Overview

  

Welcome to ALGOGENE Research Lab!

This technical document will guide you through researching and developing a quantitative trading strategy in ALGOGENE. It covers many of the basics of ALGOGENE's API, and is designed for those who are new to the platform. All you need to get started is to have some basic Python programming skills.

A trading algorithm is nothing but a computer program with pre-defined rule sets to execute trade orders. It has benefits over human traders in the timeliness and accuracy of execution, the computational speed for big data analysis, and the elimination of emotional effects. Most trading algorithms make decisions based on mathematical or statistical models that are derived from research conducted on historical data.

To develop a successful algorithm for live trade, it is crucial to find an economic or statistical relationship on which we can base our strategy. Then, we will define our trading strategy and test whether it can effectively generate returns based on historical data. In the next section, you can explore what kind of historical datasets are available in the platform.

Good Luck and Happy Trading!:)
